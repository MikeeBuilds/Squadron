[{"body":"Add isolated Git worktree support for each Squadron agent task. This is critical for team safety and allows agents to safely operate in parallel without risk to the main branch.\n\n## Goals\n- Each new agent task gets its own Git worktree: `.worktrees/task-XXX/`\n- Main branch is untouched until merge/review\n- Tasks in progress cannot conflict; easy to discard failed work\n\n## Implementation\n- Introduce `create_worktree(task_id)` in `squadron/swarm/agent.py`:\n  ```python\n  def create_worktree(task_id):\n      worktree_path = f\".worktrees/task-{task_id}\"\n      subprocess.run([\"git\", \"worktree\", \"add\", worktree_path, \"-b\", f\"squadron/task-{task_id}\"])\n      return worktree_path\n  ```\n- Modify agent runner to execute in this workspace\n- Ensure cleanup/discard logic after merge/fail\n\n## Tasks\n- [ ] Implement worktree creation, usage, and cleanup\n- [ ] Document restrictions and edge cases (e.g. nested tasks)\n- [ ] Update tests for multi-task concurrency\n- [ ] Add usage to README (with diagram)\n\n**Impact:** Brings safety and parallelism like top agent platforms. Prevents data loss and increases trust for enterprise workflows. \n\n----\n\n_Reference: Priority 3 in 2025 scaling plan_","number":8,"title":"Implement Git worktree isolation for agent tasks (Safety & Parallelism)"},{"body":"Upgrade Squadron dashboard visuals to deliver a polished, professional experience.
